### Procedure

### Configuration :
- Configure the parameters to Design a singly reinforced beam. 
- Width of support w1 and w2 ranges between 0.23 to 2 (m). Also nomial cover ranges between 20 to 70 (mm). 
-  Click on Next Arrow button after selecting all the values. 

### Configure  T-beam :
- Configure the parameters required to design T-beam.
- Calculate the value of bf. Verify your answer and go to next level.

### Calculations : 
- Calculate effective cover, factored load, effective span, shear force and bending moment.
-  Click on Next Arrow for next level after calculation.

### OverAll Depth Vs ASt Graph with Calculations :
- Required effective depth for balanced section , Provide Overall depth (D) this is to be calculated. Calculate AST for balanced section. 
- Select Provided depth (D) and submit. click on plot graph button and observe the changes in the graph. Repeat this step for more readings.
