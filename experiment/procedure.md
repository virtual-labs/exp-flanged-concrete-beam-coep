#### Procedure

### Configuration :

- Configure the parameters to Design a singly reinforced beam
- Width of support w1 and w2 ranges between 0.23 to 2 (m). Also nomial cover ranges between 20 to 70 (mm)
- Click the "Configure" button, then click the "Next" arrow to proceed to the next level

### Configure  T-beam :

- Configure the parameters required to design T-beam
- Calculate the value of bf. Verify your answer. After three incorrect attempts, the formula and correct answer will be provided
- Calculate the self-weight of Dead Load (D.L.) and verify your answer (kN/m). Similarly, calculate the Live Load (L.L.) in kN/m and verify your answer
- Click the "Submit" button, then click the "Next" arrow to proceed to the next level 

### Calculations : 

- Calculate effective cover, factored load, effective span, shear force and bending moment.
- Click on Next Arrow for next level after calculation.

### OverAll Depth Vs ASt Graph with Calculations :

- Calculate the required effective depth for a balanced section and provide the overall depth (D). Similarly, calculate the AST for the balanced section
- Select different values of total depth (D) in mm, submit them, then click the 'Plot Graph' button to observe the graph
