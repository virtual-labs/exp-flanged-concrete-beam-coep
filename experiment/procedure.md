# PROCEDURE SECTION

## Configuration

- Enter the **width of supports** `w1` and `w2` within the range of **0.23 m to 2 m**.
- Enter the **nominal cover** in the range of **20 mm to 70 mm**.
- Click on the **“Configure”** button and then proceed to the next step by clicking the **“Next”** button.

## Configure T Beam Parameters

- Enter the following parameters:
  - **Width of web (bw)**
  - **Depth of flange (Df)**
  - **Span Length (L)**
- Calculate the **width of flange (bf)** using the following formulas: <br>
 For T beams: bf = (l<sub>o</sub> / 6)+ bw + 6Df <br>
For L beams: bf = (l<sub>o</sub> / 12) + bw + 3Df <br>
Where, l<sub>o</sub> = distance between points of zero moments in the beam
- After **3 incorrect attempts**, the correct value and formula will be displayed.
- Calculate the **dead load** and **live load**, and verify the answer.
- Click the **"Submit"** button and then click the **"Next"** arrow to proceed to the next level.

## Calculations

- Calculate the following: <br>
Effective cover = Nominal cover + (bar diameter) / 2 <br>
Effective span = Centre to centre distance between the supports <br>
Factored load = 1.5 × (Dead Load + Live Load) <br>
Bending moment = (wL<sup>2</sup>) / 8 <br>
Shear force = (wL) / 2
- Click **“Next”** to proceed after verifying each value.

## Overall Depth vs Ast Graph with Calculations

- Calculate the required **effective depth** for a balanced section and provide the **overall depth (D)**.
- Similarly, calculate the **Ast** for the balanced section.
- Select various values of **overall depth (D)** in **mm**.
- After submitting multiple depths, click the **“Plot Graph”** button to observe how **Ast** varies with **D**.
